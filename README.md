# Recursion_Problem_Set_1
This repository contains important recursion problems 

1.First folder contains basic practice set for recursion to get started with the fundamentals 
        - Recursion to print integers upto n ( n=5 Output: 1 2 3 4 5 )
        - Recursion code to print the sum of the digits of a number ( n=12345 output:15 )
        - Recursion to print factorial of a number
        - Recursion to print a pattern 
        - Fibonacci sequence 
 2. LeetCode Problem 39
 3. LeetCode Problem 40
 4. LeetCode Problem 22
 5. LeetCode Problem 78
 6. LeetCode Problem 300
 7. LeetCode Problem 9
 8. This program is not a LeetCode problem however it is important for its approach/intuition building (Pick , Not Pick approach ) . This is a program to find subsequence of a vector.
 9. Also not a LeetCode Problem but a variant of the no. 8 where you have find susequence whose sums make up the target .
 10. LeetCode Problem 90
 11. GeeksForGeeks Subset Sum Problem
 12. Subsequence Problem Variant
